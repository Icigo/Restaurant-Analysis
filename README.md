Analysis on restaurant data using python

## Overview
    Cuisine Classification: We have developed a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines. This model utilizes various features of restaurants to accurately predict their respective cuisines.

    Location-based Analysis: We conducted a geographical analysis of the restaurants in the dataset. This analysis provides insights into the distribution of restaurants across different locations, helping to understand geographical trends and patterns.

    Restaurant Recommendation: We have implemented a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences. This system utilizes content-based filtering to suggest restaurants that align with users' specified preferences, such as cuisine type, price range, and other relevant factors.
